Description:
A simple website which shows the all uploaded images randomly on the home page. Anyone can post the picture by giving the name of his/her. And anyone can comment. If you have seen the web series called " The most hated man on hte internet " you get the point. But here,  my intention is only for fun and for my practice learning. 


Key Points:
1. Users don't need to sigin. They can see all the uploaded image on home page.
2. Includes a like and comment button under the images, Commenting can be done strangely.


DISCLAIMER: FOR PRACTICE OF MY CODING JOURNEY ONLY.
